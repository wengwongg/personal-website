Hey! I'm back with another blog post. It's been awhile but I've been very busy with my final year of university and lot's have happened! But everything has been going amazing thus far, and we're near the end with lots of employment opportunities coming up. Can't wait to get into the real world and starting earning that moolah. ðŸ’¸

This post is on placing priority on action because that's where results come from. There is no output to over-thinking your next steps. Write. Run. Speak. Whatever it is. Just act. Obviously this comes with a balance (as with everything) but the scale should be tipped towards acting and I'll discuss why here.

### Over-planning

There is obviously a time and place for developing a plan to how you should approach a given task. However, I feel like more often that not, this is taken too far and inaction results. I say all of this because I've been guilty of it too, but I've more recently placed priority to action rather than living in my head and mapping out a whole blueprint - and my life has been better off in all aspects.

For example, I know it's quite common to write up a whole to-do list and make it all beautiful, organised and structured. It's addicting to think and theorize over the work you have to do. But when it comes to actually doing the work - it's a different ball game. It's actual work. What if you had placed all of the effort into just doing the task, not being afraid of making mistakes and fixing them as they come? As opposed to over-planning everything to ensure every single thing goes smoothly, but not getting anything actually done.

### You don't know what the future holds.

I can't tell you how many times something has happened that is exactly the opposite of what I thought in my head. For instance, I thought I totally bombed an interview, and then the next week, I receive an email about being invited to the final round. You can plan everything, think you have everything understood, and have it turn out to be something totally different. That's why you should place priority to just doing the thing. It's very frequent that something pops up in the future, that you thought was never possible or never even thought of.

### Not being afraid of making mistakes

I think this deserves a post on it's own but placing priority to action also requires being fearless about making mistakes. Realising that we're not perfect and whatever we're going to do won't be entirely perfect. I find that inaction and over-planning often stems from the fear of failure. Fear of the unfavourable otucome happening. Or the fear of not completing the task to a certain standard.

To be able to have the courage to jump right into the task, you also need to be unafraid of making mistakes. We're human. We make mistakes and it's not the be-all and end-all. Pick yourself back up, see how you can fix it, learn from it and keep it pushing.

Find the beauty in imperfection and just do it.

### In essence...

Have no second thoughts. If you have that thought to do something, just do it. Self-doubt and over-thinking kills dreams. Always wanted to start a YouTube channel? But oh... what if so-and-so thinks this about my videos? Or what if this interferes with this other thing that I have? You can come up with a million excuses to not do something, and you'll never do it. But all of this can be solved if you just... for example, recorded that first video and uploaded it. It really is that simple. Remember, if you don't do it now, when will you do it? It sounds extreme, but you could just not wake up tomorrow and you'll never have the chance to do it ever again. This is the one life you have. You don't live forever. Do the things that you want to do. Reach out and get the things that you want. This really is the only time you'll be able to do it. When you're gone, you're gone, and the fun and games are over.

I sort of deviated from the main point a little bit, but I think it's also a very important reminder. But the core message is to not think too much, do that thing, because you pretty much have zero control over the future. You think it'll happen one way but something totally different happens. Often an even better outcome. Be optimistic - because **_it always works out!_**
