There is great strength in being able to move on and let things go, and acknowledging when things are out of your control. Often, persistence, holding on and the 'never give up' attitude are idealised as characterstics of power, toughness and mental fortitude. Yet, the harder task, that actually requires more strength and courage, might actually be letting things go, be and work out on their own.

### Inevitable failures

If you're actually trying in life, there is no escape from moments of failure. The greatest growth happens when you throw yourself into experiences that you're totally "unqualified" in. The trade-off is that you have the greatest risk of failing. While it might be write off that "failure is part of the journey" and that you should move on, but if you're a human being, there's no denying that defeat feels horrible. The pain of failure is very real, and sometimes even lingers.

### Paths after failure

Foundationally, there are three routes one can take after encountering failure.

1. Complain about it, blame life for your problems and completely give up.
2. Accept failure, and continue hammering at the task.
3. Accept failure, switch goals, and hammer at something else.

Path 1 simply is not an option; take responsibility of everything that happens to you, seek a solution and do not complain. The harsh reality is, not only are you a burden when you complain to those around you, but it places you in a negative mindset. The problem becomes much more complicated and harder to deal with than it needs to be.

The dilemma exists between paths 2 and 3. How do you know when something is totally out of your reach, and it's time to move on? I always hear, "control what you can control", but what exactly does that entail? To me, everything seems controllable to some extent. For example, you can't control what someone else does, but you can certainly have an influence on their decisions with your words.

### It's obvious

Sometimes, it's totally clear-cut when you should just shift your focus elsewhere. For example, I did a final interview for a job position which was just perfect. The type of work. The location. The pay. The work culture. The stars had aligned. I was willing to go to extreme lengths to secure this job. After the interview, I was so confident. Genuinely, I did not even consider the possibility of rejection. A few days later, I received a rejection email and it broke me. Having had all that confidence, it felt like my understanding of everything was all wrong. Not just in the field of the work, but just how the world worked. I thought I had it all figured out, so you can only imagine my pain and confusion when I opened up the email. I proceeded to write the longest email in response to the feedback, to clear things up. Only to then be told the decision was final. I was once again distraught, but clearly, to me at least, I was better moving onto the next job at this point.

### It's not obvious

Other times, it will feel like you still have a chance. Following the age-old, universal advice of never giving up,
